# plateup starting meal selector

Adds a menu option to select the starting meal, in case the game didn't give you the option you wanted when you launched it, so you don't need to relaunch the game.

![Preview](./img/preview.png)

While paging through the options, all recipe cards on the lobby screen will update to the recipe you have selected.

Note:  This will only show the recipes that you have unlocked.
